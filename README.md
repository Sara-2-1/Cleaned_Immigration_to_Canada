# 📊 Task 2: Immigration Data Visualization (1980–2013)

## 📝 Activity Description
This activity aims to assess the students’ ability to work in a team to apply data visualization techniques in understanding data (CLO 2.3). Students implemented knowledge from lab sessions 9 and 10 by writing Python code that visualizes immigration data using histograms.

## 🎯 Objective
- Visualize the immigration distribution from **Albania**, **Greece**, and **Bulgaria** to **Canada** between the years **1980 to 2013**.
- Use overlapping histograms with:
  - **15 bins**
  - **Transparency (alpha)** of **0.35**
- Interpret insights from the plot.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`
- **Chart Type:** Histogram

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Albania** had higher immigration numbers early on but declined over the years.
- **Greece** had average immigration rates that also decreased with time.
- **Bulgaria** started similarly to Greece but showed lower values towards the end.
  
The histogram provided a clear comparative view of immigration trends, revealing patterns that are hard to detect in raw data. It demonstrated how visualization supports deeper data understanding and communication.

## 📂 Files Included
- `task2.py`: Python script to generate the histogram.
- `Cleaned_Immigration_to_Canada.csv`: Dataset used in this activity *(optional to include if large; you can add a download link instead)*.
- `output_histogram.png`: (Optional) The resulting visualization image.

## 📌 Notes
Remember to perform basic data cleaning (e.g., handling missing values) before visualization to ensure accuracy and clarity.
